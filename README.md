# Headworks F1 Homepage

## Technical specification

We decided to run own formula1 team. But we need some landing page, to promote our team.
Our designer designed landing page and you need to layout it from scratch.

You can find design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/80sxh0hx8V8jd8ikcsgQSW/Headworks-F1-Team-internship?node-id=0%3A1)

## Tips

* We provided livereload server, scss compiler and other stuff for you. All you need is to have ```nodeJs``` installed
  on your computer
* All graphics already in img folder.
* All fonts are pasted in head section, all you need is to specify it in your ```css```
* Style each bem block inside own scss file, then use ```@import``` inside ```main.scss```

## How to start project

* Make sure you have Node js installed
* Clone this repository
* Go to project folder and run ```npm install```
* run ```npm run start```
* have fun =)

## Requirements

3. Should use semantic html5
2. Layout should adopt for mobile devices
1. Should use [bem](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/) for class names
